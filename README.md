## Description

Welcome to The Clone Wars, my personal project where I recreate various websites to practice and enhance my HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript skills. This project isn't aimed at achieving perfect replicas of the original sites, but rather serves as a practical learning exercise. While the idea of cloning websites for practice isn't new, I find it to be an enjoyable and effective way to improve my web development abilities.
